# Lazy Tree

A ground-up approach to tree generator, as a Blender addon.

_this is a first very tentative version for the script_

# Installation
Install the lazy-tere.py files within the Blender add-ons interface. Tested with Blender 3.4

# TO-DOs
* Add general presets
* Split sections, each with a preset
* Set Top and Bottom parameters on the same row.
* Implement a pruning logic, that adds a chance for thin branches to break over time depending on the weight on them and the number of iterations (If a branch is broken, the child branches won't be displayed)
* Add Bark noise
* Add strips of extra material on the branches and trunk. This could be done by duplicating the whole tree and creating partially overlapping cylinders.


# Licensing
Check out the LICENSE.txt file. The TL;DR would be "use it for whatever, but not to sell models, please".
